# DS-U4-S3-Deep-Learning

Starting from basic Convolutional Neural Networks and moving up to Variational Autoencoders these notebooks explore many ways to recognize, decompose, or classify image data. Perhaps most importantly, learning transfer allows us to implement a much more developed model to finally answer some questions regarding frogs, lillypads, and possibly both.
